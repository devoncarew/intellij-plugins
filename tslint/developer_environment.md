# Setting up a development environment

## Import the project
* Fork this project, clone it to your machine
* Launch IDEA and `File -> New -> Project from Existing Sources...` the `tslint` directory as a Gradle project
* At this point you should be ready to go!  Launch the "runIdea" Gradle task and start hacking.
